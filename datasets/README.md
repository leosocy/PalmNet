## PolyU Palmprint Database

The multi-spectral palmprint database contains four spectra (red, green, blue, and near-infrared NIR).

A database of each spectrum was collected from 250 subjects (195 males and 55 females).

The age distribution ranged from 20 to 60 years old. The whole collection process was divided into two times. A total of 12 images of two palms were collected at a time.

Therefore, 24 images from 2 palms were collected for each volunteer under each spectrum. In total, the database contains 4 spectra, each of which includes 6000 images of 500 different palms.

## Tongji Palmprint Database

Tongji University palmprint database: based on non-contact device acquisition.

Contains images of palms from 300 individuals (192 men and 108 women), of whom 235 were 20 to 30 years old and the rest were 30 to 50 years old.

The whole collection process is divided into two times. The average time interval between the first and second time is about 61 days. The maximum and the shortest time intervals are 106 days and 21 days respectively. Each time, 20 pictures of two palms are collected.

Therefore, each subject collected 40 images from 2 palms, which contained a total of 12,000 image samples.
